Description: Specify your requirements as a vector, optionally install anything
    you don't have, load everything you need. I wrote this package because sometimes
    checkpoint and packrat are burdensome when you're doing rapid development (or
    rapid manuscript-writing). These functions ensure your scripts and documents
    will run for anyone with R. You specify all the requirements of your package
    neatly in a character vector, and loadr installs and loads those dependencies
    for anyone who runs your code.
